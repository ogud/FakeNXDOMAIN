             Signaling NSEC record owner name nonexistence
                    draft-ogud-fake-nxdomain-type-00

Abstract

   DNSSEC was to large extent designed for off-line signing.  A number
   of new opportunities arise when on-line signing is used.  In negative
   answers case there is no real need for the wildcard proof and the
   server can just state that the queried name and type do not exist in
   a single NSEC/NSEC3 record.  But such a minimally covering NSEC
   record that shares the name with the query name can not set the
   NXDOMAIN RCODE.  Still, some applications want to explicitly know if
   the name does exist.  This document allocates a new DNS RRtype that
   can be used to signal nonexistence of the owner names of NSEC/NSEC3
   records.

1.  Introduction

   The DNSSEC Specification [RFC4035] is largely designed for off-line
   signing [RFC4471] with minimal thought for as how on-line signing
   systems can give out smaller/better answers.

   One way to give a validate-able negative answer for a question when
   the name does not exist is to state that the name exists but the type
   does not.  This allows to generate one NSEC instead of two.  This
   works great for resolvers as they see that what was asked for does
   not exist and thus tell the application that.

   There is a sub-class of applications that care if the name exists
   rather than the type and the question is asked to check for the
   existence of the name and not the type.  The above approach makes
   life hard for these applications.

   To support both of the above expectations we propose to define a
   RRtype, that has no body and never exists (i.e. a meta-type).  When
   the bit for this type is set in the NSEC/NSEC3 bitmap the application
   can take that to mean "the right RCODE for this answer would be
   NXDOMAIN".

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Changes

   This document specifies a special DNS RRType [RFC1035] that can only
   appear in NSEC/NSEC3 bitmaps [RFC4034] to signal that:

      this is an on-line signed answer

      none of the owner name nor the target name or any name in between
      them exist

      this name is not covered by any wildcard

   The purpose of this is to signal that the "right answer" for this
   query was RCODE=3 and multiple NSEC/NSEC3 records in the authority
   section, but because the answer was signed on-the-fly it was
   pretended that the query name exists but the type does not, thus
   answering with RCODE=0 and one NSEC record in the authority section.
   We call this RRType FakeNXDOMAIN or FDOM, type code is TBD.

   An authoritative DNS server SHOULD NOT be extended to load this type
   or any other meta type.

   A resolver MAY translate the returned NSEC record in a RCODE=3
   answer, if it so chooses, to clients that do not ask for DNSSEC
   answers.

4.  IANA Considerations

   We request an assignment in the "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters"
   registry sub-registry "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" for a type code
   FDOM (Fake DOMain name) suggesting using the lowest Meta-Type code
   available 128.

5.  Security Considerations

   While the content of the answer changes with this technique, its
   actual meaning is the same and such an answer can't be replayed by an
   attacker to mean anything else than its intended meaning.

   An application sensible to the difference between a nonexistent name
   and a nonexistent type SHOULD support the RRType defined in this

   document, and can rely on it to retrieve the information they look
   for securely since the NSEC/NSEC3 bitmap is signed.
