    <abstract>
      <t> DNSSEC was to large extent designed for off-line signing. A
	number of opertunites open up when on-line signing is used. In
	this case there is no real need for wildcard proof as the
	server can just say name does not exist. There are some
	applications that want to know if the name does not exist. 
	This document creates a new DNS RRtype that can be used to
	signal non-existence of NSEC/NSEC3 record owner names.

    <section title="Introduction"> 
      <t> The <xref target="RFC4035"> DNSSEC Specification</xref> is
	  largely designed for <xref target="RFC4471">off-line signing</xref> with minimal thougth
	  for as how on-line signing systems can give out
	  smaller/better answers. One way to give a validatable answer
	  for a question is to say name exists but the type does not. 
	  This works great for resolvers as they see what was asked for
	  does not exist thus they tell the application that. 
	</t> 
      <t> There is a a sub-class of applicaitons that mostly care if
	the name exists rather than the type, the question asked was
	to check for the existence of the name not the type.
      </t> 

      <t>To support both of the above behaviors we propose to define a
	a RRtype that has no body and never exists. When the the bit
	for this type is set the applicaiton can take that to mean
	"the right RCODE for this question was NXDOMAIN".
	</t>

    <section title="Requirements Notation">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Changes">
      <t> This document specifies a special DNS RR
      Type<xref target="RFC1035"/> that can only appear in
      NSEC/NSEC3<xref target="RFC4034"/> to signal: 
    <list style="bullets"> 
      <t> this is an on-line signed answer </t>
      <t> and none of the owner name nor the target name or any
      name in between them exists.   </t> 
      <t> this name is not covered by any wild card</t>
    </list>
    The purpose of this is to signal that the "right answer" was
      RCODE=3 and multiple NSEC/NSEC3 recods in authority section, but
      because the answer was signed on-the-fly we can pretend the
      query name exists but type does not, thus answerign with RCODE=0
      and one NSEC record in the authority section. 
      We call this RRType FakeNXDOMAIN or FDOM, type code is TBD. 
     </t> 
	
      <t>An authoritative DNS server should not be exteneded to load
        this type. 
      </t>
      <t>A resolver can translate the returned NSEC record in a
      RCODE=3 answer if it so chooses, to clients that do not ask for
      DNSSEC answers. 
      </t> 
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>We request an assignement in the "Domain Name System (DNS)
      Parameters" registry sub-registry "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" for a
      type code FDOM (Fake DOMain name) suggesting reusing one of the never
      implememented type like SINK, NIMROD
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t> TBD. makes answers smaller, enables lying and telling the
      truth at the same time.
